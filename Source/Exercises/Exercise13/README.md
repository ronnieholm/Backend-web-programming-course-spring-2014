# Exercise 13: Car with if-statements

This exercise is only about *observing* how we can use *if*-statements to 
implement some business logic. The solution contains a class called Car, 
in the file Car.cs.

There are three methods in the Car class that use if-statements:

  - IsEconomic
  - IsFamilyCar
  - RentalPricePerDay

For each of these methods:

  1. For each of these three methods, make sure you understand what the 
     possible return values are and under what circumstances each value 
	 can be returned.
  2. Read the code at the top of Car.cs. It tests the Car class. Before 
     running the program, try to predict the outcome.
  3. Run the program and check that the outcome is as you predicted. If not,
     you may need to read the Car class code again.
  4. Try to change some of the values used when creating the three Car objects, 
     and see if you can predict the outcome of running the program.
