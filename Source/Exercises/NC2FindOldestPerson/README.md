# Non-computer exercise 2: Find the oldest person in a group of people

Consider this seemingly trivial problem: 

Find the oldest person in a group of people.

Write down the logic necessary to solve this problem in enough detail 
to make each step trivial. This is probably not too hard. Now consider 
how fast your logic is. If it takes one minute to find the oldest person 
in a group of 20 people, how long will it take to find the oldest person 
in a group of 200 people? What about a group of 200,000 people? 

Can you come up with a faster way of solving the problem (Hint: how many 
people are comparing ages in your logic?)
