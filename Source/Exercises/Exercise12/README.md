# Exercise 12: Geometry

This exercise is about *defining* a new class yourself. In the project there is a file called Geometry.cs 
containing an empty definition of a class Geometry.

We have to fill out the class definition. The requirements for the Geometry class are the following (use 
Google if you cannot remember the geometrical definitions):

- Given the two side lengths of a rectangle, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
- Given the two side lengths of a rectangle, calculate the area of the rectangle
- Given the radius of a circle, calculate the area of the circle
- Given the four angles of a polygon with four sides, determine if the polygon is a rectangle 
  (what conditions must the angles fulfill?)

Given these requirement, your tasks are:

1. Fill out the Geometry definition, such that all requirements are fulfilled. This includes 
   definition of instance fields (are any needed?), constructors and methods
2. Make some test code that tests your Geometry class. That is, you should create a Geometry 
   object, call the various methods, and check the results against manually calculated results
3. If you have time left, try to extend the class definition with various interesting geometric 
   methods. It is up to you to define requirements, etc.

Note: This is a fairly large and somewhat difficult exercise. Try to solve it in small steps – get 
a little bit to work, test it, and then proceed to the next little bit. Manage the complexity.
