# Exercise 18: Correct change

This exercise is about calculating the correct change when a customer pays a due 
amount with too much cash. Example: A customer has to pay 266 kr, but pays 
500 kr. The customer must then receive 234 kr. in change. The tricky part is 
to figure out how to pay this amount using ordinary bills and coins and paying 
back as few bills and coins as possible. 

In the above case, the correct way to pay back correct change would be:

  - 1 200-kr bill
  - 1 20-kr coin
  - 1 10-kr coin
  - 2 2-kr coins

In the project there are no extra classes so the code needed for the problem 
can be added in the runner.

  1. In the indicated place in the code, add code to calculate the correct 
     change. To keeps things simple, we assume that you only use 100-kr 
	 bills, 10-kr coins and 1-kr coins. Remember to test your code with 
	 some different values for change.
  2. If you have time, include some more bills and coins, like 50-kr 
     bills, 5-kr coins, etc.
