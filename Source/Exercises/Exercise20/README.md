# Exercise 20: SmallMathLibrary

This exercise is about implementing some loop-based methods in a 
class definition.

The project contains a new class MathLib which contains four 
methods for various calculations:

  - Faculty
  - IntervalSum
  - HighestSquareBelowLimit
  - IsPrime

The method declarations are given, but the method bodies need to be 
completed. The purpose of each method is described in detail in the 
class definition itself (read it!). In InsertCodeHere.cs, some code 
has been added that tests the correctness of the methods in MathLib. 
Have a look at that code as well.

  1. Implement the method Faculty, and use the test to check that 
     it works as expected
  2. Implement the method IntervalSum, and use the test to check 
     that it works as expected
  3. Implement the method HighestSquareBelowLimit, and use the test 
     to check that it works as expected
  4. Implement the method IsPrime, and use the test to check that 
     it works as expected (NB: Difficult!)
