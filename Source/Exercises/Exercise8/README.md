# Exercise 8: Using a class

This exercise is about using an existing class. The solution contains 
a new class called Student in the file Student.cs. 

1. Have a look inside the Student.cs file and see what the 
Student class definition contains (constructors, methods, 
etc). See if you can figure out what each method does. The 
comments for each method should be helpful 
2. Now try to use the Student class yourself. Insert some new 
code into the solution (in the Main method), 
that does the following: 
(a) Creates a new student object 
(b) Adds a few test scores to the student 
(c) Prints out the name and average test score for the 
student (use Console.WriteLine(...)) 
3. After this, you should extend the code in the Student class, 
such that it can also hold information about the country for 
the student. More specifically, you need to: 
(a) Add a new instance field to hold the country value 
(b) Change the constructor to include a country value in the 
parameter list (also remember to use the new 
parameter to initialise the country instance field) 
(c) Add a method GetCountry to return the country value 
4. Finally, test your new code by updating the code from part 2 
such that country information is also used here
