# Exercise 17: While loops 1

This exercise is about observing how a few counter-controlled while-loops work, 
and then try to code a few on your own.

  1. In the file WhileLoops.cs four cases of while-loops (Case 1-4) have been 
     implemented. Try to figure out what the output from each loop will be. When 
	 ready, uncomment the line in each loop that prints the current value of the 
	 variable and see if you were right.
  2. Following the four given cases are four additional cases (Case 5-8). Here you 
     must implement a while-loop yourself to produce the output given in the comment 
	 for each case.
