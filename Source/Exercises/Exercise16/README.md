# Exercise 16: MedicalAnalyzer

This project contains a class called *BodyAnalyzer* with a completed method 
*CalculateBMI* plus an unfinished method *AnalyseBMI*. BMI stands for "Body 
Mass Index" (Google it). The unfinished method does compile, but it is not 
implemented correctly.

Your job is to correctly implement the method AnalyseBMI. The specification 
is as follows:

  - If the BMI is less than 15, it must return "You are way too skinny"
  - If the BMI is between 15 and 22, it must return "You are a bit skinny"
  - If the BMI is between 22 and 28, it must return "You are just fine"
  - If the BMI is between 28 and 35, it must return "You are a bit overweight"
  - If the BMI is more than 35, it must return "You are way too fat"

As always, remember to write some code that tests your work.
