# Exercise 3: Arithmetic I

The code contains several arithmetic statements (eight in total). 
Note that the program does not print anything if you run it. 
 
For each case, you should try to figure out what the final value of 
the variable is. When ready, see the result by 
uncommenting the statement that prints out the value of the 
variable. 

You uncomment a statement by removing the initial pair 
of backslashes (//): 
 
Change

    // Console.WriteLine("The value of a is : {0}", a); 

to 

    Console.WriteLine("The value of a is : {0}", a); 
 
and likewise for subsequent cases. 
 
Remember that you run the program by pressing F5 or clicking on 
the small green triangle.
