# Exercise 21: Introducing lists

This exercise is about predicting the result of applying 
some methods of the List class to a List object and also 
about writing some code to use a List object.

  1. In the ListExamples class a List object is created and some 
     elements are added and removed. At four points in the 
	 code (Case 1-4), you must predict the outcome of the 
	 *WriteLine* statement. When ready, you can uncomment the 
	 *WriteLine* statement and see if your prediction was correct.
  2. Following the cases above, four more cases are given (Case 
     5-8), where you must write pieces of code that use the *List* 
	 object to retrieve various information about the elements 
	 in the list. Details for each case are given as comments 
	 in the code for each case.
