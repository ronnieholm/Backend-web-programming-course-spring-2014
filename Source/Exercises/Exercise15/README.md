# Exercise 15: Numerology

This project contains a class called *MysticNumbers* with a single method 
*ThreeNumbers*. All that is known about *ThreeNumbers* is that it takes 
three integers as input and returns one of them.

1. By reading the code for *ThreeNumbers*, try to figure out what it does. 
   Write some test code to see if you're right.
2. Write and test a new method *TwoNumbers* that does the same thing as 
   *ThreeNumbers* but now only for two numbers.
3. Write and test a new method *FourNumbers* that does the same thing as 
   *ThreeNumbers*, but now for four numbers (tip: you can probably use the 
   method *TwoNumbers* to make the code fairly short and easy).
4. Rewrite *ThreeNumbers* to use the *TwoNumbers* method. What code do you 
   like best? The original code or the new code?
