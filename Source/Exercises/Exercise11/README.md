# Exercise 11: Bank account class definition

This exercise is about *defining* a new class yourself In the project there 
is a file called BankAccount.cs, containing a empty definition of a BankAccount
class.

We have to fill out the class definition. The requirements for the bank account 
class are the following:

- It must have a name which is the name of the account holder
- It must have a balance which is a decimal number.
- It must have a method Deposit which you can use for depositing an amount 
  to the account, i.e., the balance should increase
- It must have a method Withdraw which you can use for withdrawing an amount 
  from the account, i.e., the balance should decrease
- It must have methods for returning the value of the account holder name, 
  and the value of the balance (one method for each value)

Given these requirement, your tasks are:

1. Fill out the BankAccount definition such that all requirements are 
   fulfilled. This includes definition of instance fields, constructors,
   and methods
2. Make some test code that tests your BankAccount class. I.e., you should 
   create a BankAccount object, call the withdraw/deposit methods, and use 
   the available methods to check that the object behaves as expected with 
   regards to the value of the balance
3. If you have time left, try to extend the class definition with methods 
   for adding interest to the account. It is up to you to define requirements, etc.

Note: This is a fairly large and somewhat difficult exercise. Try to solve it 
in small steps. Get a little bit to work, test it, and then proceed to the next 
little bit. Manage the complexity.
