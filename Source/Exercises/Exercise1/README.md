# Exercise 1: Cars

Download the C# project CarVersion1 from the class website. 
 
Compared to the Sandbox project, you will find that the single line 
of code inside the InsertCodeHere.cs file has been replaced with 
several declarations of variables. All the variables are supposed to 
represent facts about a car. 
 
1. For each variable consider if the purpose of the variable is 
clearly understandable from its name. 
2. For each variable consider what actual values each variable 
can have. Is this consistent with the purpose of the variable? 
3. For each variable, make a assignment statement that assigns 
a proper value to the variable. Do this in the place indicated 
by the comments in the code. 
4. Make sure that your program can compile. Press F6, and 
make sure you get 0 errors (note that you'll probably get 
some warnings about the variables not being used for 
anything. Ignore those warnings for now).
