# Exercise 19: For loops

This exercise is about predicting the outcome of a couple of for-loops and 
to try to change some given while-loops into for-loops.

  1. In the file ForLoops.cs, two cases of for-loops (Case 1-2) have 
     been implemented. Try to figure out what the output from each loop will 
	 be. When ready, uncomment the line in each loop that prints the current 
	 value of the variable, and see if you were right.
  2. The code also contains two while-loops (Case 3-4). Run the program to 
     see what the output from each loop is. Now change each while-loop to 
	 an equivalent for-loop, i.e., a for-loop that produces the same output.
