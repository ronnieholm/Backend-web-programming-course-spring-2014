# Exercise 7: Observing a class

This exercise is only about observing how an existing class is used. 
 
Have a look inside the Car.cs file and see what the Car class 
definition contains (constructors, methods, etc). See if you 
can figure out what each method does. The comments for 
each method should be helpful. 
  
Observe how the Car class is used. Make sure you understand how:
 
  * Objects are created 
  * Parameters are specified in the constructors 
  * Methods are called 
  * Parameters are specified when calling a method 
  * Return values are used 
 
If you have time left you can try to create a third Car object 
yourself, and call some methods on the object.
