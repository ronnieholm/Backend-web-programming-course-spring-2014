# Exercise 4: Arithmetic II

Your task is to write arithmetic statements corresponding to the 
below cases (variables are indicated in *bold*): 
 
1. Set *a* equal to the product of 5 and 7 
2. Set *b* equal to 25, then increase the value to three times as much 
3. Set *c* equal to integer division of 16 and 5 (16/5) 
4. Set *d* equal to 2.5, then divide it by 3.5 
5. Set *e* equal to *b* minus *a*, then multipy that value with *c* 
6. Set *f* equal to the remainder after dividing 24 with 6 
7. Set *g* equal to 35, then divide it with f 
 
If you have forgotten how to print out the value of a variable, then 
have a look at exercise 3.
