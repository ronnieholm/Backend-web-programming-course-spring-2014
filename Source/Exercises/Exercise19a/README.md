# Exercise 19: Draw shapes

This exercise is about trying to draw some simple shapes on the screen
using for-loops to get the job done. A very simple class DrawingTool 
is provided to help with this.

  1. Study the class DrawingTool. As you can see it is very simple. Are 
     there any good reason to have such a class at all?
  2. Using for-loops and the DrawingTool class, see if you can draw the 
     following five simple shapes on the screen (they do become harder 
	 and harder, though). Create the usual Runner class and enter code
	 there as usual.

Shape A (10 stars in a row).

Shape B (5 stars in a row, separated by spaces).
* * * * * 

Shape C (10 rows of 10 stars each).
********** (1)
********** (2)
