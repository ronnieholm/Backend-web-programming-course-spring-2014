# Exercise 2: Bank account

Consider the problem of representing the properties of a 
bank account. 
 
1. Come up with as many relevant properties for a bank account 
that you can think of (to get you started: name of account 
holder, bank account number, ...) 
2. Declare variables in the code to represent these properties. 
Remember to 
a. Choose a good name for each variable 
b. Choose a suitable type for each variable 
3. Following the variable declarations, assign proper 
values to each variable, and make sure to check your 
code can actually compile (hit F6 and make sure there're no errors)
