# Exercise 6: Logical expressions II

Your task is to write a couple of logic statements. First, you must 
declare two integer variables *a* and *b*, set *a* equal to 7, and set *b* 
equal to 12. 

Now write logical expressions for each of the cases below. That is, 
the expression should become true if the condition in the case is 
true. 

In each case, declare a boolean variable and set it equal to 
the value of the expression, like: bool bool1 = ...; 

1. *a* is smaller than 10 
2. *a* is larger than or equal to 7 
3. *a* is not equal to 12 
4. *a* is smaller than 10 AND *a* is larger than 5 
5. *a* is smaller than 10 AND *b* is not equal to 10 
6. *a* is larger than 10 OR *b* is larger than 10 
7. *b* is in the interval from 0 to 20 AND *a* is smaller than 8 
8. *a* plus *b* is larger than *a* minus *b* 
 
If you have forgotten how to print out the value of a variable, then 
have a look at exercise 5. 
 
If you have time left, try to vary the initial values of *a* and *b*, and 
see how it effects the results.
