# Exercise 9: Using and modifying existing class

This exercise is about using and modifying an existing class. The 
solution contains a new class called Book in the file Book.cs. 
 
1. Have a look inside the Book.cs file and see what the Book 
class definition contains. It is a fairly simple class with some 
instance fields, one constructor and some Get methods. The methods 
BorrowFromLibrary and ReturnToLibrary are 
noteworthy. They are to be used when a user loans a book 
from the library and returns it again. Also, the method 
PrintInformation prints out all information about a book. 
2. Now try to use the Book class yourself. Insert some code into 
the solution (in the Main method), that does 
the following: 
(a) Creates a new Book object 
(b) Print out some information about the book (there is a 
method you can call for that, remember?) 
(c) Loan the book and print the book information again 
(d) Return the book and print the book information again 
3. After this, we decide that we want to keep track of the 
number of times a book has been borrowed. To do this, you 
must add code to the Book class. More specifically, you need 
to:  
(a) Add a new instance field numberOf Loans to store the 
number of times a book has been borrowed (what 
would be a good type to use for this field?) 
(b) Update the constructor to give this instance field an 
initial value (what seems like an obvious initial value?) 
(c) Figure out when we should change the value of the new 
field (Hint: What method will be activated when you 
borrow a book?) 
(d) Add a method GetNumberOfLoans, that will return the 
value of the new field 
(e) Update the code that prints book information, so that it 
also includes the number of times the book has been 
loaned 
4. Finally, test your new code by updating the code from part 2. 
You should try to loan and return a book several times, to see 
if the value for number of book loans is updated correctly 
5. [Extra – only if you have time] It seems strange that we can 
call BorrowFromLibrary many times, without calling 
ReturnToLibrary in between those calls. That does not make 
sense in the real world. Could we somehow change the code 
to handle this (Hint: That would probably require use of a 
conditional statement, which we have not really talked about 
yet)?
