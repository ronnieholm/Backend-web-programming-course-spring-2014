# Exercise 5: Logical expressions I

The application contains several logic statements (eight cases in total). 
Note that the program does not print anything if you run it. 
 
For each case, you should try to figure out what the final value 
(true or false) of the variable in that case is. When ready, see the 
result by uncommenting the statement that prints out the value 
of the variable. 

You uncomment a statement by removing the initial pair of backslashes (//): 
 
Change 

    // Console.WriteLine("The value of bool1 is : {0}", bool1); 

to 

    Console.WriteLine("The value of bool1 is : {0}", bool1); 
 
and likewise for the subsequent cases. 
 
Remember that you run the program by pressing F5 or clicking on 
the small green triangle.
